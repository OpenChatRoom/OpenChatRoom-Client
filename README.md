# OpenChatRoom-Client
> [!warning]
> As of 2025 Glitch has shutdown project hosting, the backend for OpenChatRoom has gone down with it. If you would like to host your own, get a copy of the backend from the [archive](https://github.com/OpenChatRoom/OpenChatRoom-Server/releases/tag/ARCHIVE-FINAL-VERSION). Then using the OpenChatRoom terminal, set the client endpoint to your server's endpoint. If anyone wants to provide an offical server for this project, submit a pr with replacing the glitch url for the backend, with yours.
